# Circular Journeys Frontend
The Travel-themed website is built using technologies including the React library for the frontend, Node.js for the server-side, and MySql database to handle data storage and retrieval.

The website has been designed into four main features include: Member Center, Travel Blog, E-commerce Platform, and a customizable touring feature.

I played a key role in building out the ecommerce page and implementing a secure payment system for our users. One of the key features I worked on was integrating the Stripe API to provide a seamless payment experience that ensures customer data is kept secure.

To help with styling, I utilized Sass, a powerful CSS preprocessor that allows for cleaner and more efficient code. I also applied Material UI to create an intuitive slider bar for filtering product prices, which helped to improve the user experience.

For added visual effects, I incorporated Animate.css, a library that provides pre-built CSS animations that can be easily added to elements on the page. It was used for the shopping cart.

I implemented react-loading-skeleton, a library that provides customizable placeholders for images while they're being loaded in the background.

Finally, I used CORS and Express to handle HTTP requests and responses, and to prevent cross-platform resource sharing errors.
